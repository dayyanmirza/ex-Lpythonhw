# Bottom Up

Process:

1. Take a small piece of the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely.
2. Refine the code into something more formal with classes and automated tests.
3. Extract the key concepts you're using and research them.
4. Write a description of what's really going on.
5. Go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over.
6. Repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem.‚Äù

Sidenote: Good when you know some parts of the puzzle but not the overall concept. Breaking down the code into little bits and exploring code helps understand the problem until its solved, but then do research and clean it up, as your solution is likely to be weird.
