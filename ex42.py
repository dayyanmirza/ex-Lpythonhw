## Animal is-a object (yes, sort of confusing) look at the extra credit 
class Animal(object):

    def __init__(self, name):
        ## Cat has-a name
        self.name = name

## Dog is-a Animal
class Dog(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        ## Dog has-a name 
        #self.name = name 
        super().__init__(name)


## Cat is-a Animal
class Cat(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        ## Cat has-a name
        #self.name = name
        super().__init__(name)                
   
## Person is-a object
class Person(object):

    def __init__(self, name):
        ## Person has-a name 
        self.name = name    

        ## Person has-a pet of some kind 
        self.pet = None  # so self.pet attribute is set to none as a default.   

## Employee is-a person
class Employee(Person):

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        ## Employee has-a name. (Person has-a name which is-a name of a Employee.)
        super(Employee, self).__init__(name) # same as --> super().__init__(name);  super() is used so the Employee (subclass/parent class) can inherit the init (specifically the name attribute) of the Person (superclass) class. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbVq_FIYDA
        ## Employee has-a salary 
        self.salary = salary #Â don't use super on this as the superclass doesn't have salary as an attribute.

# super() = Function used to give access to the methods of a parent class.
#           Returns a temporary object of a parent class when used --> in order to access the methods of the parent class (superclass).

But everything is an object in the sense that it can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function.
# This is so important that I'm going to repeat it in case you missed it the first few times: everything in Python is an object. Strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are objects. From the link above.

# multiple inheritance is when an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class. --> considered ambigious as difficult to determine where the features are inherited from. --> bad practice.
