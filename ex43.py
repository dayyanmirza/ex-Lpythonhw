# Object-oriented analysis & design 

# Process:
# 1) Write or draw about the problem. 
# 2) Extract key concepts and research them.
# 3) Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
# 4) Code the classes and a test to run them.
# 5) Repeat and refine.

# Notes:
"""
- When writing/drawing out the problem look for the nouns and verbs used to see how they're related. --> list of concepts for -> names of classes, functions, objects etc. --> if you don't understand any then research.

- Then create an outline/tree of the concepts and how they're related as classes, i.e. step 3 in the process above.

- Then you take the nouns and see how they are related and if they are they might have the same parent class.

- Once the tree is created, class hierarchy, then check if the verbs can be functions names inside the classes.

- With the class hierarchy figured out, make some basic skeleton code with just the classes, their the functions (inside), nothing more.

- You then write a test that runs this code and makes sure the classes you've made make sense and work right.

- Sometimes you can write the test first, or write a little test, then a little code, then a little test, little code etc, until its built.

- Repeat the process and keep refining until its absolutely clear before doing any implememntation.

- Sidenote: If you get stuck because you find a concept or problem you didn't anticipate then do the process again only for that part, to figure it out before continuing.
